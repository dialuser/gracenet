# GRACENet

### This repo contains codes for our 2019 WRR paper, 

_Sun, A. Y., Scanlon, B. R., Zhang, Z., Walling, D., Bhanja, S. N., Mukherjee, A., & Zhong, Z. (2019). Combining physically based modeling and deep learning for fusing GRACE satellite data: can we learn from mismatch?. Water Resources Research, 55(2), 1179-1195._

### The ML code was programmed in Keras.

```convBasinRev2.py```:  This is the main code for machine learning

```convBasinPredictRev.py```: Code for uncertainty analysis

```gldasBasinRev2.py```: This is the main code for pre-processing data

Postprocessing routines, ```plotAllBasinCorrelationRev.py```, ```plotPredictionResults.py```

Note: the India groundwater well database is curated by co-author S.N. Bhanja, who's currently a postdoc at the Oakridge National Lab.
